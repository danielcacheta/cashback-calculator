# Cashback Calculator

## Info

This project has been created to allow customer to keep track of the cashback amount generated by any given transaction.

## Steps to run the project

This project has been built with Node.js.
In case you would like to use the same tools versions I'm using currently, you could install Node.js 14.17.5 LTS version.

For NVM users, the commands are:

```sh
$ nvm install 14.17.5
$ nvm use 14.17.5
```

And to check if the correct version is enabled, you can run:

```sh
$ node -v
```

Run a "npm install" to download all dependencies
It should display "v14.17.5" after the nvm steps

Download all dependencies and start the project:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
