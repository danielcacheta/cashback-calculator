# Cashback Calculator

## Info

This project has been created to allow customer to keep track of the cashback amount generated by any given order.

It stores data on a SQLite database that will be created on the project root folder as soon as the application runs.

## Steps to run the project

This project has been built with Node.js.
In case you would like to use the same tools versions I'm using currently, you could install Node.js 14.17.5 LTS version.

For NVM users, the commands are:

```sh
$ nvm install 14.17.5
$ nvm use 14.17.5
```

And to check if the correct version is enabled, you can run:

```sh
$ node -v
```

It should display "v14.17.5" after the nvm steps

Download all dependencies and start the project:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

For development environment, it is also possible to run the project with nodemon and make it able to update automatically when the source code is changed:

```sh
$ npm install -d
$ npm run dev
```

## Integration tests

The test suite for Postman is compatible with Collection v2.1.
It expects that the application is already running to execute the tests.

After imported on Postman, you will be able to view and run the tests for each endpoint:

It is possible (and highly recommended) to run the entire suite after creating new features. This is the option that allow to run all the tests at once:

And after the tests are complete, you'll be able to check the tests summary:
